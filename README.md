# Coldline Necrobyl (v2)

As the project Coldline Necrobyl is still "early" in its development cycle, we are starting over in a blank Godot template to evade future trouble with our current code.
The game idea itself stays the same, enhancing only the project's structure and code, making it more robust as we have learned many important features during the dev cycle, that are more time consuming to implement, than start from scratch.
